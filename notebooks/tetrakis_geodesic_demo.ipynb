# Tetrakis Lattice Geodesic Bending Demo

This notebook demonstrates how a +45° wedge deficit (point-mass curvature analog) in a degree‑19 tetrakis-square lattice distorts the shortest-path ("geodesic") distances from a source vertex.

The lattice and defect logic are imported from the modular `tetrakis_sim` package.  
You can adjust grid size or defect position easily for further exploration.

# Build the tetrakis-square grid

# Select the source node (can adjust as needed)

## Further Exploration

- Change `size` or `defect_center` above and re-run the notebook.
- Try other source vertices (e.g., `(size//2, size//2, 'A')` for a central launch).
- Compare the result with and without a defect by commenting out `apply_wedge_defect`.
- Analyze how the "wavefront" bends or stretches near the defect.
